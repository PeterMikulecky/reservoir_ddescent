# Decision log

Append-only record of project decisions. Each entry: date, status, the decision, the
reasoning, and alternatives rejected. **Never edit or delete a past entry.** When a
decision is reversed, add a new entry that supersedes it and link back. This is the
project's memory of *why* things are the way they are — the thing most easily lost as
a project grows or collaborators join.

Status values: **Accepted** · **Accepted-provisional** (agreed, but gated on a pending
check) · **Superseded** (link to the entry that replaces it).

**Decision authority.** PJM has autonomy over this project's scientific direction. The
complex-systems group is a stakeholder and audience — a source of comparison and critique,
and the eventual venue — not an approval gate. Decisions here are made on their merits and
recorded; group buy-in is sought where it changes what *they* do (e.g. the comparative
ladder), not as a precondition for proceeding.

### D001 — Brian2 uses numpy code generation, not C++ compilation
**2026-07-13 · Accepted**
Reservoir simulations run with `prefs.codegen.target = "numpy"`.
*Reasoning:* avoids C++ compile-cache contention across parallel workers, and removes
the MSVC toolchain dependency entirely (no need to launch from an x64 Native Tools
prompt). *Rejected:* Brian2's default Cython/C++ mode — faster per-sim, but the
compile churn and toolchain requirement outweigh it for a parallel sweep. *Revisit if*
per-simulation speed becomes the bottleneck and we're willing to reintroduce the
compiler.

### D002 — Participation ratio (PR) is the master dimensionality axis
**2026-07-13 · Accepted**
"Effective dimensionality" throughout the project means PR of the reservoir state
covariance. *Reasoning:* it's the measurable quantity Frank's verbal "regulatory
dimensionality" maps onto, and it dissociates from neuron count and connectivity.

### D003 — Model-size double descent is load-bearing; epoch-wise is exploratory only
**2026-07-13 · Accepted**
Confirmatory (pre-registered) claims rest only on the model-size / architectural
mapping (synapses = parameters, PR = dimensionality). The epoch-wise "training-time =
circuit-age" version is assessed separately and never carries a pre-registered
conclusion. *Reasoning:* the architectural mapping is near-literal; the temporal one
substitutes a learning process for selection and rests on a softer metaphor. *Rejected:*
making the age story load-bearing — higher ceiling, but one skeptic on the metaphor
sinks the result.

### D004 — Run provenance: run IDs, manifests, and the confirmatory firewall
**2026-07-13 · Accepted**
Every run gets a structured ID (see NAMING.md) that names its output directory; each
run writes a manifest (git hash, config snapshot, env, seeds). `reg` (confirmatory)
runs abort on a dirty git tree. *Reasoning:* makes results reproducible and prevents
confirmatory output from uncommitted code. *Rejected:* filename-based versioning of
scripts — git already carries code identity.

### D005 — Code version lives in git, not in filenames
**2026-07-14 · Accepted**
Scripts keep stable filenames across revisions; "which version" is the git commit hash,
recorded in each run's manifest (with its commit message, as of this date). *Reasoning:*
git tracks a file's evolution as one lineage; `_v2_final` filenames don't. *Discipline:*
commit before running; tag milestone versions (e.g. `git tag T0-v2-transient`).

### D006 — UTC timestamps everywhere
**2026-07-13 · Accepted**
Run-ID timestamps are UTC. *Reasoning:* avoids timezone drift once runs happen on
multiple machines / collaborators.

### D007 — One sweep = one run = one results table
**2026-07-13 · Accepted**
A parallel sweep is a single provenance run; workers only compute rows, the parent
writes the results table and the registry once. *Reasoning:* avoids concurrent-write
races on the registry, keeps run granularity meaningful.

### D008 — Code repo is local + GitHub, NOT in OneDrive
**2026-07-14 · Accepted**
The working tree (code + `.git`) lives on a local drive (`C:\dev\...`) and is backed up
via a private GitHub repo. *Reasoning:* git and OneDrive both manage the same `.git`
internals; OneDrive syncing them mid-write can corrupt the repo. GitHub does the
backup job OneDrive would, with no downside. *Note:* the earlier 6-month OneDrive
project was fine because it used **no git** — git is the new ingredient that forces
this. *Rejected:* code in OneDrive (hardening `.git` exclusion is fiddlier than just
keeping it local).

### D009 — Run data lives off the local drive; cloud folders are archive-only
**2026-07-14 · Accepted**
Live runs write to a local (or external) drive via `DDESCENT_RUNS_ROOT`. Cloud-synced
folders (OneDrive/Google Drive/Dropbox) are **never** the live write target — only a
resting archive. *Reasoning:* real-time sync collides with the pipeline's rapid,
sometimes-parallel writes (esp. the frequently-rewritten registry). Reading an archived
run is fine; writing to a synced folder is not. *Rejected:* pointing the pipeline at a
cloud folder — even hardened with atomic-retry writes, it leans on retries more than we
want.

### D010 — Archiving is move-not-copy, verify-before-delete, prompt-per-run
**2026-07-14 · Accepted**
`archive_runs.py` moves **completed** runs to the OneDrive archive, verifies every file
(size + SHA-256) at the destination before deleting the local original, and prompts y/n
per run. Re-analysis is a manual copy-back — no resolver, no breadcrumbs. *Reasoning:*
frees local space with a safety net against half-synced copies; re-analysis is rare and
deliberate, so automating it would add fragile machinery for little gain. *Rejected:* an
auto-resolver + stub-leaving system — more moving parts than the problem warrants.

### D011 — Terminal is Windows cmd, not PowerShell
**2026-07-14 · Accepted**
Scripts, `setup.bat`, and `.vscode/settings.json` assume cmd. *Reasoning:* `.bat`
scripts and the project's path/env conventions target cmd; PowerShell differs on
invocation and env syntax.

### D012 — E1 flagship pivots from static to temporal inputs
**2026-07-14 · SUPERSEDED by D014 (2026-07-14)** — the premise was a misdiagnosis; see D014.
E1 (the fixed-N dissociation) moves from static input patterns to a temporal task.
*Reasoning (as stated at the time, now known to be wrong):* the T0 tuning sweep showed that with static, settled-state reading, PR
varies <2% across the full connectivity range (and only ~3.7% even reading the
transient) — PR is anchored to input dimensionality, and recurrent connectivity is only
a second-order effect. Recurrence genuinely shapes effective dimensionality only when
the network integrates an input *history*. This is also closer to Frank's framing of
regulatory circuits processing signals over context. *Gated on:* a temporal
PR-responsiveness check — confirm connectivity strongly moves PR in the temporal regime
before rebuilding E1 around it. *Framing consequence flagged:* changes what the reservoir
models (instantaneous map → memory/trajectory system); requires re-examining whether
H1–H5 need restatement. See design_doc.md temporal-pivot revision.
*Rejected:* staying static with higher input dim K and a chaotic regime — likely fights
the same input-anchoring problem.
**Why superseded:** the flat PR was an artifact of our own weight scaling, not a property
of static inputs. With coupling in the operative range, static gives ~124–159% PR spread
across density — as good as or better than temporal. The static/temporal axis was never
the binding constraint.

### D015 — The density→PR finding is scoped narrowly; it does NOT bear on Frank's core claim
**2026-07-14 · Accepted**
Our result "PR decreases as density increases" is recorded as: *one route* to more wiring
(uniform ER density at fixed per-synapse weight), in *one* coupling regime, at N=300, one
input distribution, unstructured graph. It is **not** evidence for or against Frank.
*Reasoning:* (a) **generalization is still entirely unmeasured** — H1 (PR → generalization)
is the load-bearing claim and we have not touched it; (b) Recanatesi et al. show
dimensionality varies widely *at fixed density* by motif arrangement, and reciprocal/trace
motifs can *raise* it — so "more wiring" arranged differently may well raise PR, and ER
density is the least structured possible way to add wiring, whereas regulatory networks are
modular/hierarchical; (c) Litwin-Kumar et al. (2017) find dimension is an **inverted-U** in
in-degree — our p = 0.02–0.4 at N=300 (K ≈ 6–120) likely sits almost entirely on the
descending limb (their optimum was K ≈ 9 at N=1000), so we may simply never have observed
the ascending limb. **Action:** sweep much lower densities before making any directional
claim. *Standing rule:* no claim about Frank's thesis until generalization is measured.

### D016 — PR is our chosen operationalization of Frank's "dimensionality"; this is an interpretive commitment, not a measurement
**2026-07-14 · Accepted · refines D002**
Frank's "overparameterization" is a **parameter count** (as in the ML double-descent
literature, where the x-axis is #parameters vs #data). Our PR is a property of the
**representation**. Equating them is a substantive interpretive choice that must be argued
explicitly in any writeup, not inherited silently. *Consequence:* H5 (does the interpolation
threshold scale with PR rather than nominal count?) is not a side hypothesis — it is the test
of whether this very identification holds, and is the most Frank-specific thing we have.
*Alternative measures to consider:* kernel rank / generalization rank (Legenstein & Maass
2007), information processing capacity (Dambre et al. 2012).

### D017 — Systematic related-work review precedes further building; E1 repositions toward a fixed-count motif dissociation
**2026-07-14 · Accepted** *(the "needs group endorsement" gate is removed — see Decision
authority in the header. Reposition target itself is refined by D019 and superseded as
flagship by D021.)*
A first targeted search shows the individual links we planned to test are largely
established: readout double descent = random-feature double descent (Belkin 2019);
density → dimensionality = Litwin-Kumar (2017, feedforward, inverted-U) and Recanatesi
(2019, recurrent spiking); dimensionality → task performance = Litwin-Kumar 2017,
Cayco-Gajic 2017, Legenstein & Maass 2007; E2/E3/E4 mechanisms = the very papers Frank
cites. See REFERENCES.md "Positioning".
*Decision:* (1) do a **systematic related-work review before further building**; (2)
reposition E1 away from the density sweep toward the design that appears genuinely open —
**hold N *and* synapse count fixed, vary only motif structure (SONET) to move PR, and test
whether generalization tracks PR.** This isolates dimensionality from parameter count and
directly pits Frank's "dimensionality per se" against "specific circuit features" (motifs
*are* circuit features), so either outcome is informative. *Enabled by:* Recanatesi et al.'s
finding that PR varies widely at fixed p by arrangement.
*Reasoning:* the pilot as designed is largely a re-derivation of known results in a new
substrate wearing an evolutionary frame. Acceptable for a group pilot; not what we said we
were building. Better to learn this now than after the flagship run.
*Open:* whether the group wants novelty at the framing level (evolutionary/comparative,
E7) or at the result level (the motif dissociation, H5). These call for different investments.

### D014 — Recurrent coupling uses fixed per-synapse weights (w0), not gain renormalization
**2026-07-14 · Accepted · supersedes D012**
`ConnectivityConfig.w0` (fixed per-synapse weight, no renormalization) is the coupling
mode for E1. Operative range for this LIF model is **w0 ≈ 0.5–3.0**.

*Reasoning — two compounding faults found, both ours, not the model's:*
1. **Renormalization erased the effect under test.** Both prior modes held effective
   coupling ~constant as density varied: the `spectral_radius` mode rescales W to a fixed
   target rho; the `gain` mode divides by √(p·N), which also pins rho ≈ gain. Sweeping
   density while renormalizing gain holds constant the very quantity that mediates
   density → dimensionality. Recanatesi et al. (2019) vary connection probability
   *without* renormalizing, and dimensionality responds strongly.
2. **The weight scale was ~60× too small for recurrence to matter at all.** Control test:
   at w0 = 0.05 (≈ what spectral-radius normalization produced) PR was numerically
   identical to a network with *no recurrent synapses whatsoever* (15.06 vs 14.97).
   The "edge of chaos at rho ≈ 1" heuristic is a **rate-network** result; in this spiking
   LIF model with reset and refractoriness, the entire rho ∈ [0.5, 2.0] sweep sits in a
   dead zone where recurrence has no measurable effect on PR.

*Evidence:* with w0 in the operative range, PR spread across density = **124–159% (static)**
and **127% (temporal)**, versus ~0–4% under renormalization. Direction matches Recanatesi
et al.: **PR decreases as density increases.**

*Consequences:*
- **E1 is viable, and stays static.** No framing change; H1–H5 need no restatement on this
  account. The design_doc temporal-pivot revision is not needed.
- **H2 gains strong prior support.** Frank's intuition is that more wiring → more
  dimensionality; Recanatesi et al. and our own data both show dimensionality *decreasing*
  with connectivity. This sharpens H2 from "possibly non-monotonic" to a directional
  prediction with independent literature backing.
- `spectral_radius` is retained only for legacy comparison and is documented as unsuitable
  for E1; the ConnectivityConfig docstrings now carry the warning.
- **Methodological lesson (generalize this):** when sweeping a structural variable, verify
  no normalization is holding the mediating quantity constant, and run a
  *disconnected-network control* to confirm the manipulated component has any effect at all
  before interpreting a null. Both faults were invisible to the tuning sweep, which was
  measuring a real quantity in a regime where the independent variable did nothing.

*Credit:* found via targeted literature search (Recanatesi/Ocker/Buice/Shea-Brown 2019,
PLOS Comp Biol; Legenstein & Maass 2007; Büsing et al. 2010), not from first-principles
reasoning — which had produced a confident and wrong mechanistic story.

### D022 — Flat-landscape check: assumption confirmed, and it exposed a design flaw
**2026-07-14 · Accepted**
Measured (N=300, min-norm readout): **above threshold (n=50 ≪ M=300) training NMSE ≈ 1e-29
for every genome, including PR = 2.5** — the landscape is exactly flat, as D021 assumed.
Rank is full at min(n,M) *regardless of PR* (rank 49 at n=50), so a prior hypothesis that
low-PR genomes would fail to interpolate was **wrong**: rank and PR are different things.
**Below threshold (n=400 > M=300) training error varies ~6× (0.05–0.43) and favors high PR.**
*Bonus finding:* since rank is full regardless of PR, **PR does not relocate the interpolation
threshold** — it sits at nominal capacity. Independent confirmation of D018 (H5 retired) from
our own data rather than the RMT literature.
*The flaw it exposed:* "neutral network" *means* selection has no signal — that is the
definition. Running a GA there is drift with extra steps. Frank's claim about that regime is
that the **learning dynamics** (here: the min-norm readout solver) pick the interpolating
solution — that is E4's implicit-bias question, not an evolutionary one. The gate did its job:
found before building.

### D023 — E9 rev. C: readout capacity M becomes a heritable gene
**2026-07-14 · Accepted · revises D021**
Genome gains **`M`** (readout capacity): `(M, p, w0, recip, ei)`. The readout taps M of N
neurons; N=1000 becomes the *pool*, with **N ≫ n** the binding constraint (n ≈ 50–100).
*Reasoning:* the double-descent x-axis is the **learned**-parameter count = the readout
weights = M. Recurrent weights are structure, not learned. If the experimenter fixes M, "does
evolution find overparameterization?" is unaskable — we chose the answer. **C is the only
variant in which Frank's central claim is testable.**
*The prediction that justifies it:* below threshold selection pushes M up (training error
falls with M); above threshold training error is flat at zero so cost pushes M down. They meet
at **M ≈ n = the test-error peak** → **selection with any parameter cost parks a lineage at the
worst-generalizing capacity (G1)**. At **c_syn = 0**, the plateau is neutral with a reflecting
boundary at M = n, so M drifts *upward* and generalization improves via the second descent
(G2). **Frank's aside that biology doesn't penalize complexity turns out to be the precise
condition his thesis requires.** `c_syn` is therefore the central swept axis, not a nuisance —
the evolutionary form of E4's ridge-vs-min-norm contrast.
*Also:* C separates two readings of Frank's "parameterization" that he does not distinguish —
`M` (learned parameters) vs `p`/`w0`/`recip` (regulatory structure) — and can ask which
behaves as claimed. Sharpens D016.
*Rejected:* rev. A (below-threshold only — has signal but abandons the overparameterized
regime, i.e. Frank's distinctive claim); rev. B (accumulating environments — the crossing is
imposed by the experimenter growing n, whereas in C the lineage discovers it; B can be layered
onto C later).
*Cost concern withdrawn:* "the design grows" was filed as a cost out of a reflex toward
minimal designs. The additions (a fifth gene, M-identity question, M×p×w0 interactions) *are*
the mechanism of the experiment, not overhead.
*Credit:* PJM — the question "is that growth bad?" reversed the recommendation.

### D024 — Production scale is N = 1000
**2026-07-14 · Accepted**
N=300 was a sandbox-probe tractability choice, never a principled production decision.
*Benchmark:* per-individual cost scales **sublinearly** in N (N=800 is 1.6× N=200, not 16×)
because the D014 `w0` mode skips the O(N³) eigenvalue call the old `spectral_radius` mode
required. At N=1000, pop 50 × 100 gens ≈ **1–2 h on 6 workers**. Affordable.
*Also:* N=1000 matches the group's original brainstorm and both Litwin-Kumar (2017) and
Recanatesi (2019) — direct comparability. Prototype at N=300; scaling checks per D020.

### D025 — Metric strategy: store the spectrum, not the scalars; tier by real cost
**2026-07-14 · Accepted**
Adopt PJM's principle (collecting beats re-running), but implement it by storing **the
object the metrics derive from**, not a longer list of scalars.
*Core insight:* PR, edof, effective rank, kernel rank and spectral entropy are all
**functionals of the same eigenvalue spectrum**. So `metrics.spectrum()` stores the top-k
singular values (float32, ~320 B/individual → **1.6 MB per 5000-evaluation GA run**), and
every spectral metric — including ones we have not thought of — is recoverable post hoc
without re-running anything. Verified: PR and edof recomputed from the stored spectrum alone.
*Why this matters concretely:* at our operative point PR = 14.6 but **edof ≈ 79** — same
spectrum, two functionals, 5× disagreement. Storing only PR would have made D018's edof
question unanswerable without a full re-run.
*Cost tiers (measured):*
- **FREE** (battery = 113 ms vs 2400 ms simulation, <5% overhead): spectrum, PR, edof at
  several κ, effective rank, spectral entropy, numerical/kernel rank, rate + diversity +
  synchrony stats, weight norm, synapse count, sparse spectral radius.
- **CHEAP** (one extra sim pass): generalization rank (needs noisy input variants).
- **EXPENSIVE** (separate protocol per individual): IPC (Dambre), Lyapunov exponent,
  robustness interval. **Do NOT run per-individual in a 5000-eval GA** — run on the final
  evolved population or a curated subset, where they are informative anyway.
- **Irrelevant**: energy efficiency (not a hardware project).
*Optimizations that made it free:* derive rank from the already-computed spectrum rather than
a second SVD; subsample neurons for the O(N²) correlation; sparse `eigs` for spectral radius
instead of O(N³) full `eig`. (3× speedup, identical values.)
*On the source list:* it recommends targeting spectral radius ≈ 1 for the edge of chaos —
the **rate-network heuristic D014 disproved for this LIF model** (our whole ρ ∈ [0.5, 2.0]
sweep was a dead zone; the battery now measures ρ = 8.4 at the operative w0, independently
confirming it). ρ is retained as a *descriptor* for literature comparability (Recanatesi's
density effect concentrates near ρ→1), **not** a tuning target. The list also omits **edof**,
the most relevant quantity per D018.
*Guard against the obvious hazard:* breadth invites the garden of forking paths. **PR remains
the pre-specified confirmatory measure (D002/D016); everything else in the battery is
exploratory** and must be reported as such. The `reg` firewall and pre-registration exist to
keep this honest — a 20-metric battery mined for whichever correlates with generalization is
p-hacking with extra steps.
*Also store:* raw state matrices X for a **subsample** (e.g. best + a few random individuals
per generation), which future-proofs *non*-spectral state metrics too. Full storage is ~800 KB
per individual → ~4 GB per run; subsampling keeps that manageable.

### D026 — "Settled" → "stationary"; two protocols; fitness is Protocol S; the averaging check is standing
**2026-07-14 · Accepted**  ·  spec: `PROTOCOLS.md`
**The network does not settle.** Settling test (N=200, 400 ms constant drive): within-window
temporal CV rises 0.077 → 0.20–0.26 as coupling grows; at w0=3, p=0.4 the rate trace still
fluctuates ~20% after 400 ms. There is **no fixed point** in the regime we care about, and it
is worst exactly where our headline effect lives. A protocol "designed to cleanly measure the
settled state" would target an object that does not exist.
*Reframe:* what is well-defined is a **stationary response distribution** (mean, covariance,
autocorrelation time of the occupied attractor). Better because it is always defined, still
faithful to Frank's GRN reading (a cell in a sustained environment occupies a characteristic
expression *regime*, not necessarily a static point), and it *tells us what to measure*.
**The confound this exposes.** We record only the distribution's mean (trailing-window average)
and discard the rest. Averaging destroys variance, and the amount destroyed **grows with
coupling** — a mechanism that would produce "PR falls with density/coupling" (our headline
finding) with none of it being a property of the representation. Recanatesi et al. find the
same direction by a different method with no window averaging — real evidence the effect is not
purely artifact — but their model is linearized Poisson, not spiking LIF with reset, so it does
not settle it for us. **Not demonstrated, not dismissed.**
*Therefore — standing, never optional:* Protocol S retains **three** readouts per pattern
(`X_mean`, `X_inst`, `X_var`) and every run reports PR on all three. Agreement ⇒ averaging is
innocent. Divergence ⇒ the window mean is manufacturing the effect. D025's logic applied to a
confound rather than a metric: bake the check in permanently rather than trusting one July run.
*Two protocols (PJM's proposal):* **S (stationary)** = sustained drive, the expensive one
(150 × 150 ms = 22.5 s sim). **T (temporal)** = one continuous stream, **~10% of S's cost** —
the asymmetry matters: adding T is nearly free, not a doubling.
*Metrics:* shared spectral core (D025 battery) on every state matrix; **S-specific** =
temporal_cv, autocorr_time, attractor_pr (PR of a *single* pattern's trajectory — only exists
under S), order_dependence (carryover check); **T-specific** = memory_capacity, separation,
IPC (deferred to the final population per D025 tiers).
**The thing that cannot be plural.** Metrics can be plural; **fitness cannot** — the GA needs
one number. S-fitness and T-fitness are *two different evolutionary models*, not two views of
one. **Decision: fitness = Protocol S** (Frank's core; already built in
`tasks.anisotropic_regression`); **T is characterization**, explicitly exploratory. No
forking-path risk: the confirmatory measure stays PR on `X_mean` under S (D002/D016).
*Deferred, not rejected:* two GA arms evolving on S- vs T-fitness, compared — a real experiment
about whether environmental structure shapes evolvability. Doubles the budget, adds a second
flagship. Worth wanting; not first.
*Consequence for T0:* the T0 run in flight measures PR through the window mean only. Its chosen
operating point may need revisiting once the three-way readout comparison exists.
*Credit:* PJM — the parallel-protocols proposal, and the prior question ("what do we hope to
capture from the settled state?") that prompted the settling test.

### D013 — Project keeps a lab notebook and this decision log
**2026-07-14 · Accepted**
`LAB_NOTEBOOK.md` (auto-appended run facts + hand-written interpretation) and this
`DECISIONS.md` are maintained as the project's narrative and governance memory.
*Reasoning:* keeps the project self-explaining as it evolves; the unifying rule across
code/outputs/narrative/rules is **append and date, never silently overwrite reasoning**.

### D018 — Retire the "PR is Frank's x-axis" interpretation test (H5) as a headline claim
**2026-07-14 · Accepted**
H5 is demoted from candidate flagship to a supporting/diagnostic measurement.
*Reasoning:* the RMT literature already establishes that **effective** dimensionality, not
nominal parameter count, sets the interpolation threshold — the peak occurs where the
normalized effective degrees of freedom η_κ = (1/n)·Tr[Σ²(Σ+κI)⁻²] → 1 (Bach 2023;
Hastie et al.; Mei & Montanari). So the abstract claim is taken. Worse, the literature also
supplies the *principled* metric (edof), which is a different functional of the same
spectrum than PR (a moment ratio). A PR-vs-edof horse race is therefore a rigged game: if
PR loses, that is the expected analytic result and not a finding; if PR wins, the natural
reading is that asymptotic assumptions fail on structured reservoir covariance — a technical
ML question, not a biological one. *Credit:* PJM's critique — "we'd need to show not only
that PR is Frank's axis but that other candidates aren't" — is what forced the check.

### D019 — The dissociation is a SCREENING-OFF test on natural scatter, not an engineered manipulation
**2026-07-14 · Accepted · refines D017**
Do **not** vary motifs *in order to* move PR. That makes structure and PR coupled by
construction and collinear as predictors — the same error class as the D014 normalization
bug (manipulating A through B, then claiming to separate them).
*Correct design:* exploit the fact that the structure → PR map is **many-to-one** (exactly
Recanatesi et al.'s finding that PR varies widely at fixed density). Build a library of
networks spanning many structural axes (density, reciprocity/motifs, E/I, heterogeneity,
coupling), let PR fall out where it falls, then locate **iso-PR networks with differing
structure** and **iso-structure networks with differing PR**. The test is conditional
independence: *given PR, does structure still predict generalization?* Frank's claim H is
precisely "**dimensionality screens off circuit features**." Natural scatter is the
instrument; a designed manipulation destroys it. *Credit:* PJM.

### D020 — E7's reference role is scoped as a scaling-and-invariants study
**2026-07-14 · Accepted · refines E7**
If the reservoir is to serve as the clean reference the group's messier systems (beehives,
colonies, boolean networks) are compared against, the deliverable is not a number but
**what scales and what doesn't**: how PR scales with N, whether the PR→generalization
relation preserves its shape across scales, and which findings are substrate-specific
versus portable. *Reasoning:* a reference point that hasn't characterized its own scaling
behaviour cannot license comparison to a colony. *Credit:* PJM.

### D021 — FLAGSHIP: evolve motif-encoded reservoirs with a genetic algorithm (new stage E9)
**2026-07-14 · Accepted · supersedes D017's reposition target as the headline**
The flagship becomes a **genetic algorithm over motif-encoded reservoir genomes**, with the
linear readout as the scoring mechanism. See `GA_DESIGN.md`.
*Reasoning:* every mechanism link we planned is already established (see REFERENCES.md
Positioning), and D018 removes the interpretation test. What the entire neuroscience/ML
literature we surveyed **lacks is selection** — no heredity, no lineage, no population.
Frank's claim is evolutionary, and a GA supplies exactly the missing ingredient. It also
makes his mapping *literal* rather than metaphorical: regulatory connections = genome,
**selective history = training environments**, selection = the optimizer, **novel
environments = test data**. No unearned analogy (contrast D003, where a learning optimizer
stood in for selection).
*Key structural insight:* in the overparameterized regime every individual interpolates the
training data, so **the fitness landscape is flat — a neutral network**. Naively this kills
selection; in fact it lands the population in precisely the regime Frank's argument is
about (his Gavrilets/neutral-space reframing: what matters is not position on a fitness
surface but which solution the dynamics find within the connected neutral region). The
central contrast therefore becomes **below vs. above the interpolation threshold**,
manipulated via the size of the selective history.
*Bonus:* the GA generates the D019 screening-off library as a byproduct — an evolved
population *is* natural scatter over structure and PR.
*Credit:* PJM's proposal.
